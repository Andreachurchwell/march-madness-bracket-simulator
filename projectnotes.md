## Day 1 Progress

### What I finished
- Fixed the project package structure so `uv` works normally
- Confirmed the `.venv` and notebook kernel are using the correct environment
- Identified the core men's NCAA datasets for the simulator
- Built working data loader functions for the main datasets
- Built the first team-season feature table from regular season results
- Created an initial Streamlit app shell for the project

### What I learned
- `TeamID` and `Season` are the main join keys
- `MNCAATourneySlots.csv` controls bracket progression across rounds
- `MNCAATourneySeeds.csv` maps teams into the bracket structure
- The regular season results can be used to build team strength features before the bracket is released

### Next session
- Merge team names and seeds into the feature table more cleanly
- Start defining sleeper-team signals
- Build matchup-level features for two teams in the same game
